## Project Introduction
This project of an embedded door lock system is described with a digital lock interfaced with a microcontroller.
The principle aim of this door lock system is to enable a door with a graphical password or a fingerprint. The user will be able to
enter a graphical password on touch screen, or use finger on a biometric sensor, to unlock the door. The user will also be able to
add or delete a stored password/fingerprint entry with the help of touch screen UI.

## Weekly Schedule
